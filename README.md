# 👋 Hi, I'm Aniket

I'm a detail-driven data enthusiast who thrives on solving complex technical puzzles. Whether it's optimizing workforce schedules in Excel or untangling MySQL error codes, I bring precision, persistence, and a love for clean logic to every challenge.

## 🔧 Skills & Tools

- **Excel Mastery**: Dynamic arrays, advanced formulas (`SEQUENCE`, `SORTBY`, `COUNTIFS`), scheduling logic, FTE calculations  
- **SQL & MySQL**: Query optimization, safe update mode handling, error troubleshooting (`1175`, `3948`, `2068`, `1046`, `1050`)  
- **Data Workflows**: Import/export between Excel & MySQL, GUI and CLI fluency  
- **Problem Solving**: Root cause analysis, system PATH fixes, iterative debugging

## 📈 Recent Projects

- 🗓️ Built dynamic date lists in Excel with month-boundary logic  
- 🧮 Refined workforce planning models using schedule counts and FTE logic  
- 🐛 Diagnosed MySQL import/update errors and enabled `local_infile` for seamless data loads  
- ⚙️ Resolved system PATH issues to enable MySQL CLI operations

## 🧠 What Drives Me

I believe in understanding the "why" behind every fix. Quick solutions are great—but elegant, repeatable logic is better. I enjoy diving deep into technical challenges and emerging with insights that improve workflows and save time.
